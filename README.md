# üé¨ IMDb SQL Case Study | EPGP Data Science ‚Äì IIIT Bangalore

This project analyzes a cleaned IMDb movie dataset using SQL to provide data-driven recommendations for RSVP Movies, a film production company planning a global movie release.

## üìå Problem Statement
RSVP Movies is an Indian film production company which has produced many super-hit movies. They have usually released movies for the Indian audience but for their next project, they are planning to release a movie for the global audience in 2022.

The production company wants to plan their every move analytically based on data and have approached you for help with this new project. You have been provided with the data of the movies that have been released in the past three years. You have to analyse the data set and draw meaningful insights that can help them start their new project.

I have to use SQL to analyse the given data and give recommendations to RSVP Movies based on the insights.The entire analytics process has been divided into four segments, where each segment leads to significant insights from different combinations of tables.
